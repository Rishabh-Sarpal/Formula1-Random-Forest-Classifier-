# 🏁 Formula 1 Big Data Performance Analysis

This project analyzes historical Formula 1 data (1950–2024) using machine learning and data science.  
It predicts race outcomes like podium finishes based on driver stats, constructor details, qualifying times, pit stops, and more.

## 🔍 What’s Inside
- 🧠 Driver & constructor performance prediction
- 📊 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- 🧹 Data cleaning & feature engineering
- 🌲 ML model: Random Forest Classifier
- 📈 Visual insights from 900,000+ records

## 💡 Key Files
- `f1_analysis.ipynb`: Complete ML pipeline in Jupyter Notebook
- `data/`: 15 CSV files with race history
- `README.md`: Project overview
- `requirements.txt`: All Python libraries used

## 🔧 Technologies
`Python · Pandas · NumPy · Scikit-learn · Seaborn · Matplotlib · Jupyter`

## 📌 Project Goals
- Train an ML model to classify race finish positions (Top 3, Top 10, Others)
- Analyze F1 trends from 1950 to 2024
- Apply real-world predictive analytics to sports
